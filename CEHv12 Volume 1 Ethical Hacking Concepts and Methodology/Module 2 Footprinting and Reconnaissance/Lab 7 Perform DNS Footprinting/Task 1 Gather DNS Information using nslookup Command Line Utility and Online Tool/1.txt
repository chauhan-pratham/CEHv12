DNS information gathering about target organizations using the nslookup command-line utility

Steps 
1) Type nslookup
2) Type set type=a
3) Type the domain name like www.google.com

Note: If the response is coming from your local machineâ€™s server (Google), but not the server that legitimately hosts the domain www.google.com;it is considered to be a non-authoritative answer.

Instead of typing set type=a you have to type set type=cname in order to get a authoritative name.

Note:The CNAME lookup is done directly against the domain's authoritative name server and lists the CNAME records for a domain.

Steps of determining the IP address of the name server.
set type=a
ns1.bluehost.com

Note:The authoritative name server stores the records associated with the domain. So, if an attacker can determine the authoritative name server (primary name server) and obtain its associated IP address, he/she might attempt to exploit the server to perform attacks such as DoS, DDoS, URL Redirection, etc.
