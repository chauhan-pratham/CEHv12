Using the tool "Reverse IP Domain Check" which is present at "yougetsignal.com" we can find the other websites which uses the same web server as our target server.

Then using the dnsrecon tool present in kali linux or other os we can locate a DNS PTR for IP addresses between the range like 

./dnsrecon.py -r 162.241.216.0-162.241.216.255

Method may be different the above is when we have .py file.
