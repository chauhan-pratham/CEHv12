### Lab 8: Perform Network Footprinting

#### Lab Scenario
As a professional ethical hacker, your task is to perform network footprinting to gather network-related information about a target organization. This information will help create a network map and facilitate potential attacks, such as a man-in-the-middle attack.

#### Objectives
- Locate the network range
- Perform network tracerouting on Windows and Linux machines

### Task 1: Locate the Network Range
1. **Open a Web Browser**:
   - On a Windows 11 machine, open any web browser (e.g., Mozilla Firefox).

2. **Access ARIN Website**:
   - In the address bar, type: `https://www.arin.net/about/welcome/region` and press Enter.
   - If a notification about "More secure, encrypted DNS lookups" appears, click to disable it.

3. **Search for IP Address**:
   - In the ARIN search bar, enter the target organization's IP address (e.g., `162.241.216.11` for `certifiedhacker.com`) and click the "Search" button.

4. **Document Information**:
   - Review the results, which will include:
     - Network range
     - Network type
     - Registration information
   - Take a screenshot of the information for documentation.

5. **Close the Browser**:
   - After documenting the information, close all open windows.
