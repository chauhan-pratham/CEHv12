#### Lab Scenario
As a professional ethical hacker or penetration tester, the next step after discovering active hosts in the target network is to scan for open ports and services running on those hosts. This discovery can be performed using various port scanning tools and techniques.

#### Objectives
- Perform port and service discovery using:
  - MegaPing
  - NetScanTools Pro
  - Sx Tool
  - Nmap
  - Hping3

### Overview of Port and Service Discovery
Port scanning techniques are categorized based on the communication protocol used:
- **TCP Scanning**:
  - Open TCP scanning (TCP connect/full open scan)
  - Stealth TCP scanning (Half-open Scan, Inverse TCP Flag Scan, ACK flag probe scan, third-party and spoofed TCP scanning)
- **UDP Scanning**
- **SCTP Scanning**:
  - SCTP INIT Scanning
  - SCTP COOKIE/ECHO Scanning
- **SSDP and List Scanning**
- **IPv6 Scanning**
