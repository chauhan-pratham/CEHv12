### Task 1: Perform Vulnerability Research in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

1. **Access CWE**:
   - Log into the Windows 11 machine and open a browser (e.g., Mozilla Firefox).
   - Navigate to [CWE website](https://cwe.mitre.org/).

2. **Search for Vulnerabilities**:
   - Click on the Search tab and enter "SMB" in the search bar to find related vulnerabilities.
   - Review the search results and click on any relevant link (e.g., CWE-284) for detailed information.

3. **Explore CWE Top 25**:
   - Navigate back to the CWE homepage and click on "CWE List".
   - Under External Mappings, select "CWE Top 25 (2021)" to view the most dangerous software weaknesses.

4. **Document Findings**:
   - Record all relevant vulnerabilities and their details for future reference.
