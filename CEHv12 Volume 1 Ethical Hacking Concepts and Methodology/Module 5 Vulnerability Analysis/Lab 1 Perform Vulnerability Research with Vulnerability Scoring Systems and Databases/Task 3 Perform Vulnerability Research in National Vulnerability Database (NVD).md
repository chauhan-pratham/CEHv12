### Task 3: Perform Vulnerability Research in National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

1. **Access NVD**:
   - Open a browser and navigate to [NVD website](https://nvd.nist.gov/).

2. **View Recent Vulnerabilities**:
   - Browse the homepage for recently discovered vulnerabilities and click on a CVE-ID (e.g., CVE-2022-0729) for details.

3. **Review CVSS Details**:
   - Check the severity section and click on the Base Score link to view CVSS metrics related to the vulnerability.

4. **Search for Service Vulnerabilities**:
   - Use the "Search & Statistics" option to find vulnerabilities associated with specific services (e.g., "SMB").

5. **Document Findings**:
   - Record all relevant information about vulnerabilities for future reference.
