### Task 1: Perform Vulnerability Analysis using OpenVAS

1. **Access OpenVAS**:
   - Switch to the Parrot Security machine (10.10.1.13) and log in with the username "attacker" and password "toor".
   - Navigate to **Applications > Pentesting > Vulnerability Analysis > Openvas - Greenbone** and start the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager Service.

2. **Open OpenVAS Dashboard**:
   - Open Firefox and go to `https://127.0.0.1:9392`.
   - Log in with the username "admin" and password "password".

3. **Create a Scan Task**:
   - Go to **Scans > Tasks** and click on the wand icon to open the Task Wizard.
   - Enter the target IP address (10.10.1.22) and click **Start Scan**.

4. **View Scan Results**:
   - Wait for the scan to complete (approximately 20 minutes).
   - Click on the **Done** button to view discovered vulnerabilities under the **Results** tab.

5. **Analyze Vulnerabilities**:
   - Click on any vulnerability to view detailed information.
   - Verify vulnerabilities manually, noting that enabling the Windows Firewall may not prevent detection of vulnerabilities.

6. **Re-scan with Firewall Enabled**:
   - Enable Windows Firewall on the target machine and repeat the scan.
   - Observe that vulnerabilities are still detected, indicating the system's exposure.

7. **Document Findings**:
   - Record all vulnerabilities and their details for future reference.
