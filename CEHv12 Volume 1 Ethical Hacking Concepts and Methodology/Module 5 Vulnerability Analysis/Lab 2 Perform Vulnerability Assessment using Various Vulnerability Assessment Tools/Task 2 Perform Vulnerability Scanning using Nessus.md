### Task 2: Perform Vulnerability Scanning using Nessus

1. **Access Nessus**:
   - Switch to the Windows 11 machine and open a browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge).
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:8834/` and proceed past the security warning.

2. **Log in to Nessus**:
   - Use "Admin" as the username and "Password" as the password to log in.

3. **Create a New Policy**:
   - Go to **Policies** and click **Create a new policy**.
   - Select **Advanced Scan** and configure the policy settings (name it "NetworkScan_Policy").

4. **Configure Scan Settings**:
   - Under **Discovery**, disable "Ping the remote host" and enable "Port Scanning".
   - Set performance options to "Unlimited" for concurrent TCP sessions.

5. **Set Credentials**:
   - Under **Credentials**, select Windows and enter the target credentials (e.g., CEH123/qwerty@123).

6. **Create and Launch a Scan**:
   - Go to **Scans** and click **Create a new scan**.
   - Select the "NetworkScan_Policy", name the scan (e.g., "Local Network"), and enter the target IP (10.10.1.22).
   - Click **Launch** to start the scan.

7. **View Scan Results**:
   - After the scan completes (approximately 15-20 minutes), click on the scan name to view results.
   - Check the **Vulnerabilities** tab for detailed reports on discovered vulnerabilities.

8. **Generate and Download Report**:
   - Click on the **Report** tab and choose a file format (e.g., HTML) to generate and download the report.

9. **Log Out of Nessus**:
   - Click on **Admin > Sign Out** to log out of the session.

10. **Document Findings**:
    - Record all vulnerabilities and their details for future reference.
